# realtime-fraud-pathway
This project demonstrates a real-time fraud detection pipeline using Pathway's streaming engine. 
It ingests live transaction data, performs on-the-fly fraud risk scoring using behavioral rules, 
and uses LLM-based RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to generate explainable fraud alerts 
backed by AML and compliance policies.

Built for a Pathway Hackathon as a production-style financial intelligence system.
